    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I posted about how I <a href="/2013/02/14/migrating-old-mac-to-new-mac/">migrate an old Mac to a new Mac</a> in a previous post.</p>

<p>After migration, I also wanted to do a clean install on the old Mac, and bring it to factory settings, but with the latest OS X (Mountain Lion for me).</p>

<p>It is very easy.</p>

<p>The steps:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Restart computer and press <strong>Command + R</strong> while it restart to get to a menu screen</p></li>
<li><p>Select <strong>Disk Utility</strong> > Macintosh HD (your startup volume) > Erase</p></li>
<li><p>Go back to menu screen and select <strong>Install Mac OS X</strong></p></li>
</ul>


<p>Follow through and it will be done!</p>

    <id>http://samwize.com/2013/02/15/apple-trackpad-4-finger-not-working</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When my new iMac was delivered, the only unsatisfactory I had was with the faulty trackpad. It can click, but can't move the cursor at all! I sent it for servicing and got a replacement after a few days.</p>

<p>Anyway, this post isn't about a new iMac with a faulty trackpad.</p>

<p>What happened is that when I use the new and working trackpad, I realized the 4 finger swipe up/down gestures were not working (therefore I can't do Expose and Mission Control).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The fix is rather trivial:</p>

<p>Go to Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures > Mission Control and change <strong>Swipe up with four fingers</strong> to <strong>Swipe up with three fingers</strong>.</p>

<p>Try it now and it should work.</p>

<p>Now, change it back to <strong>Swipe up with four fingers</strong>, and it works too!</p>

<p>Do the same trick for App Expose.</p>

<p>Finally, go to Point &amp; Click to re-enable <strong>Three Finger Drag</strong>.</p>

    <updated>2013-02-14T23:29:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://samwize.com/2013/02/14/migrating-old-mac-to-new-mac</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did a migration using the <strong>Migration Assistant</strong> app when I bought a new iMac (late 2012 27" model).</p>

<p>I decided to migrate everything (instead of a fresh install) as I DON'T want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>reinstall hundreds of apps</li>
<li>setup the system preferences</li>
<li>manually transfer files</li>
</ul>


<p>But migration is not perfect (though I think it is much efficient than doing a fresh install).</p>

<p>Here are some tips that you will be interested to know.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Create a new user with a different username</h2>

<p>In your new iMac, when you start the OS the first time, it is compulsory for you to create a new user account.</p>

<p>This is temporary. Once you migrated, the account will be deleted.</p>

<p>Don't create a user account with the same username as that from the old Mac, as that will cause a conflict, and you have to start over at some point in the migration. This tip could save you 10 minutes.</p>

<h2>2. Transfer medium using cross cable</h2>

<p>This is up to you. For me, I choose to connect the 2 Macs using a cross ethernet cable.</p>

<p>It took 8 hours to migrate nearly 500 GB of data.</p>

<h2>3. Most things are good</h2>

<p>Once migrated, most things are good.</p>

<p>Your applications are there. Your OS settings are intact. Your files are there.</p>

<p>In the next sections, it tells some of the things that were broken.</p>

<h2>4. Dropbox</h2>

<p>Your dropbox folder is there, but it is not synced.</p>

<p>You have to reinstall Dropbox, and they will resync like old times.</p>

<h2>5. Git</h2>

<p>Your <code>git</code> command cannot be recognized. Simply <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">download</a> and install again.</p>

<h2>6. Octopress</h2>

<p>It is best you go through this <a href="http://samwize.com/2012/09/11/how-to-setup-octopress-on-github-pages/">octopress setup guide</a> again.</p>

<p>Explicitly, you do need to install OS X GCC Compiler and bundle install.</p>

<h2>7. Eclipse, and Plugins</h2>

<p>If you open and encounter an error, simply <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">reinstall</a>. You need to install Google Plugin for Eclipse too if you are using.</p>

<h2>8. More..</h2>

<p>More to be updated as I use my new iMac :)</p>

    <link href="http://samwize.com/2012/10/28/wifi-scanner-for-mac-osx-mountain-lion/"/>

    <id>http://samwize.com/2012/10/28/wifi-scanner-for-mac-osx-mountain-lion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mountain Lion comes with a Wifi Scanner that is much better than you expected.</p>

<p>I tried out <a href="http://kismac-ng.org/">KisMAC</a> at first, but couldn't get it working. I hate reading their lengthy <a href="http://trac.kismac-ng.org/wiki/NewbieGuide">newbie guide</a>.</p>

<p>Then I found a gem in Mountain Lion.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It turns out the Wi-Fi Diagnostics Tool (app) in Mountain Lion is updated with new features. It has added a wifi stumbler to discover the wifi nearbys (ssid, channel, protocols, etc).</p>

<p>To do a Wifi scan,</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to terminal and <code>open open /System/Library/CoreServices/Wi-Fi\ Diagnostics.app/</code></p></li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>File</strong> > <strong>Network Utilities</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Press Scan</p></li>
</ol>


<p><img src="/images/wifi-scanner-mountain-lion.png" title="Scan Results" ></p>

<p>That's it. You got to see the details of wifi nearby.</p>

<p>PS: I was looking for a uncongested, clear channel to use.</p>

    <link href="http://samwize.com/2012/09/26/xcode-4-dot-5-tips-and-tricks/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-26T01:16:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://samwize.com/2012/09/26/xcode-4-dot-5-tips-and-tricks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of my favorite Xcode tips &amp; tricks (tested on Xcode 4.5).</p>

<h2>Shortcut</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/xcode-shortcuts.png" title="xcode shortcuts" ></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Catch All Exceptions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Bring up breakpoint navigator (⌘6)</li>
<li>Click + on the bottom left</li>
<li>Add Exception Breakpoint</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/xcode-catch-all-exceptions.png" title="xcode catch exceptions" ></p>

<p><em>Anyone knows the difference with <a href="http://blog.just2us.com/2012/02/find-the-real-exception-in-xcode-debugger/">symbolic breakpoint</a>?</em></p>

<h2>NSLog, Auto Continue on Breakpoints</h2>

<p>Breakpoints are so much powerful. Don't limit to just pause on every breakpoint.</p>

<p>You could set actions such as log a message under certain condition, or automatically continue. Or if you are not interested in the first 10 times of a while loop, you can ignore x times before pause. Or even have your Mac speaks out instead of traditional text logging.</p>

<p>Edit a breakpoint for more options:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/xcode-nslog-on-breakpoints.png" title="breakpoints actions" ></p>

<h2>Use of Tabs</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create new tabs with ⌘T</li>
<li>Double click to edit tab name</li>
<li>My workflow uses these tabs: Project Resources, Design, Coding 1, Coding 2, Build</li>
</ol>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/xcode-tabs-workflow.png" title="tabs for my workflow" ></p>

<p>It's totally up to you to organize your tabs, just like web browsing.</p>

<h2>Use of Behaviours</h2>

<p>Behaviours are hooks to Xcode for events like build, test, run, and search. You can find them in <strong>Preferences</strong> > <strong>Behaviours</strong>.</p>

<p>These are my additional behaviours.</p>

<p>Show Build tab when there is new issue:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/xcode-behaviour-build-new-issues.png" title="'Show Build tab when there is new issue'" ></p>

<p>Show console when start running:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/xcode-behaviour-console.png" title="'Show console when start running'" ></p>

<p>Show Debug tab when paused:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/xcode-behaviour-debug-tab.png" title="'Show Debug tab when paused'" ></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When my new iMac was delivered, the only unsatisfactory I had was with the faulty trackpad. It can click, but can&#8217;t move the cursor at all! I sent it for servicing and got a replacement after a few days.</p>

<p>Anyway, this post isn&#8217;t about a new iMac with a faulty trackpad.</p>

<p>What happened is that when I use the new and working trackpad, I realized the 4 finger swipe up/down gestures were not working (therefore I can&#8217;t do Expose and Mission Control).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The fix is rather trivial:</p>

<p>Go to Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures > Mission Control and change <strong>Swipe up with four fingers</strong> to <strong>Swipe up with three fingers</strong>.</p>

<p>Try it now and it should work.</p>

<p>Now, change it back to <strong>Swipe up with four fingers</strong>, and it works too!</p>

<p>Do the same trick for App Expose.</p>

<p>Finally, go to Point &amp; Click to re-enable <strong>Three Finger Drag</strong>.</p>

    <id>http://samwize.com/2013/02/14/migrating-old-mac-to-new-mac</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I did a migration using the <strong>Migration Assistant</strong> app when I bought a new iMac (late 2012 27&#8221; model).</p>

<p>I decided to migrate everything (instead of a fresh install) as I DON&#8217;T want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>reinstall hundreds of apps</li>
<li>setup the system preferences</li>
<li>manually transfer files</li>
</ul>


<p>But migration is not perfect (though I think it is much efficient than doing a fresh install).</p>

<p>Here are some tips that you will be interested to know.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>1. Create a new user with a different username</h2>

<p>In your new iMac, when you start the OS the first time, it is compulsory for you to create a new user account.</p>

<p>This is temporary. Once you migrated, the account will be deleted.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t create a user account with the same username as that from the old Mac, as that will cause a conflict, and you have to start over at some point in the migration. This tip could save you 10 minutes.</p>

<h2>2. Transfer medium using cross cable</h2>

<p>This is up to you. For me, I choose to connect the 2 Macs using a cross ethernet cable.</p>

<p>It took 8 hours to migrate nearly 500 GB of data.</p>

<h2>3. Most things are good</h2>

<p>Once migrated, most things are good.</p>

<p>Your applications are there. Your OS settings are intact. Your files are there.</p>

<p>In the next sections, it tells some of the things that were broken.</p>

<h2>4. Dropbox</h2>

<p>Your dropbox folder is there, but it is not synced.</p>

<p>You have to reinstall Dropbox, and they will resync like old times.</p>

<h2>5. Git</h2>

<p>Your <code>git</code> command cannot be recognized. Simply <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">download</a> and install again.</p>

<h2>6. Octopress</h2>

<p>It is best you go through this <a href="http://samwize.com/2012/09/11/how-to-setup-octopress-on-github-pages/">octopress setup guide</a> again.</p>

<p>Explicitly, you do need to install OS X GCC Compiler and bundle install.</p>

<h2>7. Eclipse</h2>

<p>If you open and encounter an error, simply <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">reinstall</a>.</p>

<h2>8. More..</h2>

<p>More to be updated as I use my new iMac :)</p>

    <link href="http://samwize.com/2013/02/01/code-change-needed-in-ios-6/"/>

    <id>http://samwize.com/2013/02/01/code-change-needed-in-ios-6</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some tips on your iOS code change needed for supporting iOS 6.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>presentModalViewController</h2>

<p>Starting from iOS 6, <code>UIViewController</code> deprecated this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)presentModalViewController:(UIViewController *)modalViewController animated:(BOOL)animated
</code></pre>

<p>Starting from iOS 5, the replacement is:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)presentViewController:(UIViewController *)viewControllerToPresent animated: (BOOL)flag completion:(void (^)(void))completion
</code></pre>

<p>If you <em>really</em> need to support the older iOS 4 and below, and mix in the new replacement, you would need to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12445190/dismissmodalviewcontrolleranimated-deprecated">check</a> using <code>respondsToSelector</code>.</p>

<pre><code>if ([self respondsToSelector:@selector(presentViewController:animated:completion:)])
    [self presentViewController:navController animated:YES completion:nil];
else
    [self presentModalViewController:navController animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<h2>For older xib</h2>

<h3>Tab Bar not working</h3>

<p>If after adding support for iOS6 and your UITabBar is not working anymore eg. does not respond to taps, it could be due to the xib from an older project.</p>

<p>You <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12627117/242682">need</a> to set the <code>window</code> object of your main xib to <strong>Full Size at Launch</strong>.</p>

<h3>Error: UIViewControllerHierarchyInconsistency</h3>

<p>This is again due to an older project.</p>

<p>You <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12434937/uiviewcontrollerhierarchyinconsistency-when-trying-to-present-a-modal-view-contr/12450770#12450770">need</a> to do this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Move main <strong>View</strong> out of <strong>View Controller</strong>:</p></li>
<li><p>Delete <strong>View Controller</strong> from the XIB (it is not necessary since File&#8217;s Owner should be of its Class already)</p></li>
</ol>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you submit an iOS app to Apple, and they get back to you with the unfortunate news that your app crashed.. you have to (of course) fix the bug and resubmit again.</p>

<p>To help you, Apple engineers will</p>

<ul>
<li>explain how they did it,</li>
<li>attach a screenshot, and</li>
<li>attach a crashlog</li>
</ul>


<p>This is what you should do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Open Xcode > Organizer > Devices > Library > Device Logs > select <strong>Import</strong> at the bottom to open the crashlog file. This will <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#technotes/tn2008/tn2151.html">symobolicate</a> the crash report and let you know which line of code failed.</p>

<p>If you still do not understand why, you could install the same IPA into your device.</p>

<p>To do so, in Xcode > Organizer > Archives > Your app > Distribute > <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#qa/qa1764/_index.html">Save for Enterprise or Ad-Hoc Deployment</a>, double click and sync with iTunes. Your device will now run the same copy that you submitted to Apple.</p>

<p>Hopefully, you can then squash the bug.</p>

    <id>http://samwize.com/2013/01/18/ios-developer-tips-2013</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are starting out iOS development, there are some good tips for you from Stuart Hall:</p>

<p><a href="http://stuartkhall.com/posts/ios-development-tips-i-would-want-if-i-was-starting-out-today">http://stuartkhall.com/posts/ios-development-tips-i-would-want-if-i-was-starting-out-today</a></p>

<p>There is only one point which I don&#8217;t agree on:</p>

<blockquote><p>Story Boards Are Just For Rapid Prototypes</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>The choice between &#8220;Story Boards&#8221; vs &#8220;Code the UI&#8221; depends very much on your app requirements.</p>

<p>For simple apps that use the stock UI components, Story Board is really useful because</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Drag and drop to design = very quick and easy to make UI changes</p></li>
<li><p>Support Auto Layout easily = Design iPad and iPhone at the same time easily</p></li>
<li><p>Xcode support = Beautiful UI is possible with powerful customizable features</p></li>
</ol>


<p>In each version of iOS, Apple has made Story Board (XIB) and Xcode support much better. They kept improving. They value Story Board.</p>

<p>Hence, you will be missing out a lot if you didn&#8217;t even bother trying it out.</p>

<p>It started out as a hack via their RESTful API to automatically scan QR code and get Phewtick points ($$$).</p>

<p>Today, Phewtick released a new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/sg/app/phewtick/id487158487?mt=8">version 3.2.0</a>, which includes 2 new features: timeline and messaging.</p>

<p>Shockingly,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The timeline shows not only the friends I met with, but also the friends that my friends met with!</p></li>
<li><p>The messaging API allows me to send to anyone!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>This <a href="https://github.com/samwize/phewtick-hack">python code</a> will allow you to spam Phewtick user id 123456.</p>

    <link href="http://samwize.com/2012/11/28/how-to-migrate-svn-to-git/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-28T23:10:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://samwize.com/2012/11/28/how-to-migrate-svn-to-git</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My biggest problem with SVN is that I don&#8217;t have good Mac software supporting SVN. For Git, I have the free <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> app.</p>

<p>Hence I decided to migrate some of my ancient repos that were still on SVN.</p>

<p>It is actually easy.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It is basically just 1 command to clone the svn repos to your local working directory. The operation will maintain the logs.</p>

<pre><code>git svn clone -s http://my.svnserver.com/svn/myapp/ MyAppGit
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>-s</code> command will clone just the trunk. If you don&#8217;t use the stand trunk, tag, branch, you can <code>-s</code> and it will clone the whole repos.</p>

<p>You can verify all logs are there with <code>git log</code>.</p>

<p>Next, maintain the same ignore configurations.</p>

<pre><code>git svn create-ignore
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, add the new remote to your git repos (eg Github).</p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/samwize/myapp.git
git push -u origin master

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Making a beautiful iOS app icon takes some hard work. Even more work now that there are more devices with different resolutions.</p>

<p>This post is to provide some of the tips in the making Apple&#8217;s trademarked iPhone rounded icon.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Understanding the resolutions</h2>

<p>There is quite a number of different resolutions that is needed for 1 app.</p>

<p>Refer to this <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconsImages/IconsImages.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH14-SW1">Apple document</a>.</p>

<p>Note that every icon can be different in terms of how it looks. So in theory you can have a 57x57 that is totally different looking from your 512x512.</p>

<h2>Icon Template</h2>

<p>There are many template around. The most popular (now) is from <a href="http://appicontemplate.com/">http://appicontemplate.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Using Photoshop smart objects, the template let you edit the biggest size, and it will automatically scale down to the smaller sizes, and export them automatically.</p>

<h2>Rounded corner radius</h2>

<p>If you are not using the template or need a specific resolution, it is important that you know the rounded corner radius for each of the icon reolution. This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10239376/242682">discussion</a> explained well.</p>

<p>To summarize,</p>

<blockquote><p>Rounded corner radius = icon length x 10/57</p></blockquote>

<p>That is,</p>

<ul>
<li>Icon512.png - 512px - 89.825</li>
<li>Icon.png - 57px - 10</li>
<li>Icon@2x.png - 114px - 20</li>
<li>Icon-72.png - 72px - 12.632</li>
<li>Icon-72@2x.png - 144px - 25.263</li>
<li>Icon-Small.png - 29px - 5.088</li>
<li>Icon-Small@2x.png - 58px - 10.175</li>
</ul>


<h2>Mask</h2>

<p>You can get a set of mask from within Xcode.</p>

<p>Open the following directory.</p>

<pre><code>open /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator6.0.sdk/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/MobileIcons.framework
</code></pre>

<p>But there is also a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1834558/242682">way</a> to programmatically set a round corner masking:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the <a href="http://samwize.com/2012/10/03/sentestingkit-does-not-support-wait-for-blocks">greatest</a> feature with GHUnit is that it supports unit tests that perform asynchronous stuff.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://gabriel.github.com/gh-unit/docs/appledoc_include/guide_testing.html">ExampleAsyncTest</a> from GHUnit documentation provides a glimpse of what you need to do. However, it still lacks warning you on the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7613761/why-does-a-false-assertion-in-async-test-in-ghunit-crash-the-app-instead-of-just">common pitfalls</a>.</p>

<p>This is step by step of how you can use GHUnit async test:</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Subclass GHAsyncTestCase instead</h2>

<p>Change the interface class to use <code>GHAsyncTestCase</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="k">@end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Prepare and wait</h2>

<p>Setup the test method with the asynchronous/block call like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h2>Pitfall: Assert in block</h2>

<p>It is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7613761/why-does-a-false-assertion-in-async-test-in-ghunit-crash-the-app-instead-of-just">common</a> that you assert within the block.</p>

<p>But that will just give the following exception when the test fails.</p>

<pre><code>Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'GHTestFailureException', reason: ...
</code></pre>

<p>To make it work, you don&#8217;t call any asserts within the block.</p>

<p>Leave it until <code>waitForStatus</code> is unblocked.</p>

    <id>http://samwize.com/2012/11/23/app-engine-unused-discounted-instance-hour</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google App Engine has this item - Discounted Instance Hour - which you can reserve a number of hours per week at a cheaper cost.</p>

<p>Recently, I was looking at the Charge Sent per week, and one of the item is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Unused Discounted Instance Hour - Used XXX hours</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>The item cost a big part of my weekly charges. I was puzzled at first: How did I used XXX hours out of an item that said is unused?</p>

<p>Then I went to my Billing Settings, and saw this:</p>

<pre><code>Discounted Instance Hours: YYY Hours

Committing to a number of instance hours for a weekly billing period in advance can 
help lower your bill. You will be charged $0.05 per hour for the hours you commit to here, 
even if you don't use them during the billing period.
</code></pre>

<p>I have set YYY hours per week as a <strong>Reserved</strong> Discounted Instance Hours.</p>

<p>Even if I don&#8217;t use them, they are charged!</p>

<h2>Lesson Learnt</h2>

<p>At times, you should monitor the weekly usage.</p>

<p>If the <strong>Unused Discounted Instance Hour</strong> is very high (much higher than what is being used), then you should adjust it from Billing Settings.</p>

<p>I have wasted quite some money paying for instance hours that I didn&#8217;t use..</p>

<p>(I set the reserved instance hours very high initially because there was a period of peak, but now it has gone down, yet I didn&#8217;t adjust..)</p>

    <link href="http://samwize.com/2012/11/22/warning-do-not-use-base-internationalization-in-ios-5/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-22T21:57:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://samwize.com/2012/11/22/warning-do-not-use-base-internationalization-in-ios-5</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iOS 5 does NOT support Base Internationalization.</p>

<p>I learnt this the hard way (and partly Apple&#8217;s fault).</p>

<p>After upgrading my project to use Base Internationalization, I release a new version, and shortly, my users complained of startup crash.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>New release, crash on startup</h2>

<p>You might be wondering:</p>

<blockquote><p>Didn&#8217;t you test your app?</p></blockquote>

<p>I did test, <strong>but only with Simulator</strong>. I ran on Simulator with iOS 5, and also tested on my real device with iOS 6.0.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t crash on Simulator with iOS 5.</p>

<p>However, on a real iPhone with iOS 5, it crashed on startup.</p>

<p>Exception is raised from <code>[UINib instantiateWithOwner:options:]</code>, with the error log:</p>

<pre><code>Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', 
reason: 'Could not load NIB in bundle: 'NSBundle 
&lt;/var/mobile/Applications/***/***.app&gt; (loaded)' with name 'MainWindow''
</code></pre>

<p>This <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9075298/app-works-on-simulator-but-not-on-iphone">meant</a> that the app could not find <code>MainWindow.xib</code>.</p>

<p>It is strange that the xib is not copied, especially when I am prudent to do clean build and run.</p>

<h2>The culprit</h2>

<p>Base Internationalization was introduced in iOS 6. It is an awesome feature because: instead of having N NIB files for N languages, you need just <strong>1 base NIB file</strong> with <strong>N localization.strings</strong>.</p>

<p>The biggest change I had for the release was Base Internationalization.</p>

<p>Researching into the problem, I realized Base Internationalization is supported only from iOS 6.</p>

<p>Xcode will let you release the app with <em>any minimum deployment target</em>, without any warning. But once the app starts and load a xib, it will crash as it can&#8217;t find the xib.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>The change is reversible.</p>

<p>Select the XIB and look under File Inspector.</p>

<p>You can change each of the <code>localization.strings</code> back to XIB. Then remove the Base (when prompted, copied it to English).</p>

<h2>Lessons Learnt</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Simulator is not exactly like real device</p></li>
<li><p>Base Internationalization is awesome, but is not advised to be used</p></li>
<li><p>Many users stick with iOS 5 because of Map app. Perhaps they will upgrade in ~2014 as Apple continues to improve.</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have been thinking which to use.</p>

<p>I am already using Google App Engine (Java) for a few years, running a couple of web apps on production. And paying them ever since they started charging.</p>

<p>I tried a few apps on Dotcloud, but never yet deployed any on production.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Here&#8217;s what I think of them.</p>

<h2>GAE</h2>

<pre><code>+ Reliable
+ Great Docs
+ Great Community
+ On demand scaling

- Some restrictions
- User Agent has GAE..
</code></pre>

<h2>Dotcloud</h2>

<pre><code>+ Shell access
+ Can use pip install
+ Can run worker processes

- Too much things to handle
- Easily use up workers/services - Redis, MySQL, Python, ...
- Higher startup cost
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As a one-man-show developer, my bet is on GAE.</p>

<p>Though it is less flexible, it will save time and money.</p>

    <link href="http://samwize.com/2012/11/14/ios-adhoc-distribution-with-the-new-xcode/"/>
    <updated>2012-11-14T22:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://samwize.com/2012/11/14/ios-adhoc-distribution-with-the-new-xcode</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you are an iOS developer, you are probably familiar with the 3 ways to install an app - Run/debug on device, Ad hoc distribution, and App Store distribution.</p>

<p>For each of the 3 ways, Apple provisioning portal has provided the provisioning certs you must use to sign the binary.</p>

<p><strong>Adhoc distribution</strong> is the most complicated (the other 2 ways are very straight forward). Over the years, the process has also changed.</p>

<p>This post is for development with Xcode 4.5.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>In the past</h2>

<p>In the early days (year 2008), the guide to Adhoc distribution was to create a new build configuration called &#8220;Adhoc&#8221;, in addition to &#8220;Debug&#8221; and &#8220;Release&#8221;.</p>

<p>I know why it is necessary back then, but that is not necessary now. But some posts still <a href="http://diaryofacodemonkey.ruprect.com/2011/03/18/ad-hoc-app-distribution-with-xcode-4/">insisted</a> that.</p>

<h2>The new way</h2>

<p>With Xcode 4.5 (or perhaps earlier), Project Schemes is introduced. It provides more ways you can configure how you &#8220;Build&#8221;, &#8220;Run&#8221;, &#8220;Test&#8221;, &#8220;Analyse&#8221; and &#8220;Archive&#8221;. You can change the build configuration to &#8220;Debug&#8221; or &#8220;Release&#8221; as you wanted.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t need to touch them.</p>

<p>To distribute Adhoc way, you only need to &#8220;Archive&#8221;.</p>

<p>Then in Organizer, click on the &#8220;Distribute&#8221; button, and select &#8220;Save for Enterprise or Ad-Hoc Deployment&#8221;.</p>

<p>Select the Adhoc provisioning cert (you would need to download from Apple portal, and install to Xcode).</p>

<p><img src="http://samwize.com/images/xcode-distribute-adhoc-enterprise.png" title="Adhoc Distribution" ></p>

<p>Save the <code>App.ipa</code>.</p>

<p>To install, drag to iTunes and sync. That&#8217;s it!</p>

<h2>Push Notification</h2>

<p>Things get slightly more complicated if you are using Apple Push Notifications.</p>

<p>To use push, there are 2 more certs needed for your server to communicate with Apple. One is <code>aps-development</code>, the other is <code>aps-production</code>.</p>

<p>You use <code>aps-development</code> for running on device using &#8220;Debug&#8221; build configuration.</p>

<p>You use <code>aps-production</code> for both Adhoc and App Store distribution.</p>

<p>Not the other way round. Adhoc distributed apps will NOT get push when you use <code>aps-development</code>.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<blockquote><p>Because Adhoc distributed apps will register device token to <strong>Apple production gateway</strong>, while your <code>aps-development</code> communicates with <strong>Apple sandbox gateway</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you want Adhoc distributed apps to get push, you must send the push with <code>aps-production</code>. Adhoc is as good as production app, yet not on the App Store.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the past, you need to create a new build configuration call &#8220;Adhoc&#8221;. But that is no longer needed as you can select which cert to re-sign after archiving.</p>

<p>I will not cover wireless distribution today (though you may refer to <a href="http://blog.just2us.com/2010/12/wireless-ad-hoc-distribution-for-iphone-apps/">this method using dropbox</a>).</p>

<p>Or you could use <a href="https://testflightapp.com/">TestFlight</a> which is the best in distributing ad hoc builds - with versioning and beta users management!</p>

<p>This post I am going rave a bit. So..</p>

<p>tldr;</p>

<ul>
<li>Use 2 mediation - <a href="http://admob.com">Admob</a> &amp; <a href="http://mopub.com">MoPub</a> - and split them 50-50</li>

</ul>

<h2>In the early days..</h2>

<p>Back in the early days (2008), there is an obvious choice - <a href="http://admob.com">Admob</a>.</p>

<p>Back then, Admob is a startup, with strength in mobile analytics and mobile advertising. In fact, I started using them for mobile analytics in 2007.</p>

<p>When iPhone boomed, so did their value as they have a strong mobile ad network. They were eventually acquired by Google in the range of $BILLION$!</p>

<h2>Then come mediation - Adwhirl</h2>

<p>I was quite comfortable just serving ads from admob. It was also the first time that I had revenue coming from ads!</p>

<p>It was good, but I soon realized it could be better in around 2009.</p>

<p>Ads mediation became popular, and <a href="https://www.adwhirl.com/">Adwhirl</a> was the popular choice, as they are free, uncluttered, and open source.</p>

<p>By using a mediation means I start to use more than 1 ad network. Read on what I used.</p>

<p>Once again, Adwhirl was eventually acquired by Google..</p>

<h2>More ad networks</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a> was the main reason that I used a mediation. In 2009, Google was a newcomer to mobile advertising, with Admob dominating.</p>

<p>However, we all know Google has the resource to catch, plus it has good network on the web advertising. I applied to be the BETA to mobile Adsense. I got in, integrated with Adwhirl, and revenue gets even better!</p>

<p>I realized mediation does help a lot. Reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>When 1 ad network cannot be filled, it can try others</li>
<li>Inventory increased, so there is more varierty of ads shown</li>
</ul>


<p>I also integrated Quattro and Greystripe, but with little success from them.</p>

<p>And also iAd, but little success as my users are mainly outside US.</p>

<h2>The Google world is not good</h2>

<p>I have thought with the acquisition of Admob and Adwhirl, Google will provide great stuff.</p>

<p>I was totally wrong.</p>

<p>Admob is not improving. Their website design remains the same as 5 years ago. What&#8217;s worse is that by introducing mediation and house ads, they now look complicated.</p>

<p>Adwhirl is deprecated. It&#8217;s last SDK update is in 2011. If you want to use Adwhirl, you should use Admob. But there are actually better alternatives.</p>

<h2>MoPub - the new kid</h2>

<p>I started looking into <a href="http://mopub.com">MoPub</a> in 2012 for these reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Admob mediation is cranky. It reported fill rate as <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/google-admob-ads-sdk/wLMKhV2pMiA/tHfttXGfzlEJ">low</a> as 4% for my other networks! (serving Admob ads is very fine >90%)</p></li>
<li><p>Admob provides no support. Just like other Google service, it is hard to even find their support email. I posted on their Forum, but no Admob staff is replying.</p></li>
<li><p>Admob SDK will crash when they serve InMobi (hence I cannot use InMobi at all)</p></li>
<li><p>Admob website looks like in the 1990s</p></li>
</ul>


<p>To sum up, I wanted to move away from Admob.</p>

<p>MoPub looks great, and has it&#8217;s SDK opensourced.</p>

<p>One of the problem with mediation is that integration is complex, and the network adaptors could be buggy (like the InMobi case with Admob). I thought MoPub is smart to provide their SDK source code. If there is a problem, at least we can fix it.</p>

<p>MoPub also promised integration with certain ad network without the need to integrate into the app. I have yet to try.</p>

<h2>The 50-50 mode</h2>

<p>However, that said, I choose to use both Admob and MoPub as mediation.</p>

<p>When I was using MoPub, I encountered some problems too.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Frequently, it has the error &#8220;server response indicated no ad available.&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t get filled!</p></li>
<li><p>MoPub serve in a eCPM waterfall manner. That is it get ads from the network that pays best first, if not filled, then it moves on.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Because of that, MoPub often serve the same ad. I seldom see Admob/Adsense ads. I rather have variety in my inventory.</p>

<p>To play safe, I do a 50-50 split.</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<p>Install,</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip install nose
</code></pre>

<p>Then run,</p>

<pre><code>nosetests
</code></pre>

<p>nosetests will automatically find tests to run in your project! Not necessary in /tests directory (but recommended).</p>

<p>To print out the output,</p>

<pre><code>nosetests --nocapture
</code></pre>

<p>To run only certain tests,</p>

<pre><code>nosetests &lt;path/to/file&gt;:&lt;Test_Case&gt;.&lt;test_method&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is about some custom stuff I did for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/Articles/ChoosingLocalizations.html">localization</a>.</p>

<p>It does not cover the <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/2876/how-to-localize-an-iphone-app-tutorial">basic</a> of how you localized an app, nor how to use the Apple provided <a href="http://spritebandits.wordpress.com/2012/01/25/ios-iphone-app-localization-genstrings-tips/">genstrings</a> tool.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I have some particular bad vibes with using <code>NSLocalizedString</code>. I hate it being 17 characters long, and the REQUIRED comment parameter that you MUST pass in, which usually is just <code>nil</code> for me.</p>

<p>And so I have my own Macro called <code>Localized</code>.</p>

<p>Which I improved to read from other table strings, and has an awesome recursive replacement.</p>

<p>By doing that, I lose the use of <code>genstrings</code>, as it no longer uses <code>NSLocalizedString</code>. Unfortunately <code>genstrings</code> is closed source. But fortunately, some <a href="https://github.com/dunkelstern/Cocoa-Localisation-Helper">python helper</a> is around.</p>

<p>And the result is at <a href="https://github.com/samwize/localized">https://github.com/samwize/localized</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I started <a href="http://blog.just2us.com/2009/05/just2uscom-is-here/">just2us.com</a> 3 years ago, using it as a avenue for me to share about my apps and development guides.</p>

<p>Over the last 3 years, I have been actively blogging at just2us.com, as there are lots to share. I have especially enjoyed writing development guides which help fellow developers, as well as being a bookmark for myself. Many times, I had googled for <em><strong>topic + just2us.com</strong></em> to recap my memories.</p>

<p>I wanted to keep that going, but I was constantly bothered by a few things.</p>

<!-- more -->


<ol>
<li><p>My Wordpress template looks out-of-date after 3 years</p></li>
<li><p>There isn&#8217;t a good &amp; free Wordpress editor for Mac</p></li>
<li><p>I wish I can write in markdown or something</p></li>
</ol>


<p>And so.. I decided to make a bold move and switch to <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>. It is dubbed as</p>

<blockquote><p>A blogging framework for hackers</p></blockquote>

<p>It makes sense:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hacker prefers entirely static HTML, aka baked; it performs better than PHP + MySQL</p></li>
<li><p>Hacker prefers to write in markdown; it&#8217;s clear like code</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Switching wouldn&#8217;t count as risky for me, if guys like <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/">Matt Gemmell</a> (with 900+ posts) and <a href="http://felipecypriano.com/2011/09/16/why-ive-migrated-to-octopress/">Felipe Cypriano</a> could migrate successfully.</p>

<p>Time will tell if it&#8217;s worth.</p>

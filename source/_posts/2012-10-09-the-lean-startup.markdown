The Lean Startup is about a scientific approach to managing startups/entrepreneurs.

The book recommended everyone working in startups to stop whatever work they are doing, and spent the next 24 hours to complete the book.

I recommend so too.

I will be summarizing what I have learnt.

## Introduction: Why We Fail ##

In traditional management, when you fail, there are only 2 possible explanations:

1. Fail to plan 

2. Fail to execute

But what if you fail because your hypothesis is wrong in the first place? 

An execution of a perfect plan of a flawed idea, would only achieve failure. 

The book focus on testing hypothesis and fine-tuning it, in a scientific way.


## Build-Measure-Learn Cycle ##

There is usually an hypothesis to an idea, a feature, a marketing plan, a business model, and anything that the customer touches.

We always *assume* how customer will react.

Hence the introduction of this cycle:

- Build MVP (a Minimum Viable Product)
- Measure data
- Learn the goods and bads

The process is in fact reverse; You start with planning what you want to learn, what you need to measure, then build it.

## MVP = The Fears ##

We always heard about building the MVP first. However, there is usually constant debate among the teams on 2 accounts:

1. Fear of low quality/inferior product
2. Fear of idea being stolen

But,

>> If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is.

>> If only it is so easy to get good ideas stolen!

The challenge of startup is getting your product noticed by *anyone*, let alone a competitor. 

Even if the idea gets stolen, the only way for either your competitor or you to win is - to learn faster than anyone else. For that, you have a headstart.



## Measure - Innovative Accounting ##

Traditional numbers are "Vanity Metrics". eg. total number of users, total active users

It's not measuring Growth Engine.

Startup is about Growth, and the Engine that drives it. Therefore you must and should measure that.

Techniques: Cohorts, split test, A/B testing

Make Data part of the product.

3 A's:

1. Actionable Metric = clear cause and effect
2. Accessible = Everyone can access and understand in layman terms
3. Auditable = Talking to customer



## Pivot ##

There is no way to remove human element - vision, intuition, judgement.

Some are better because they have talent or experience. But it is inevitable a pivot is needed. A pivot is not a big deal for startup.

Have regular "Pivot Or Persevere" meeting. Especially if there is telltale signs.

Types of pivot:

1. Zoom-in Pivot
2. Zoom-out Pivot
3. Customer Segment Pivot
4. Customer Needs Pivot
5. Platform Pivot
6. Business Architecture Pivot
7. Value Capture Pivot
8. Engine of Growth Pivot
9. Channel Pivot
10. Technology Pivot

Pivot itself is a hypothesis. A Strategic one.

Pivot is a structural change designed to test a fundamental hypothesis about a product, business model, and growth engine.

Startup's Runway = Number of Pivots it can still make


## Growth Engine ##

Focus on one at a time (to build-measure-learn).



## Five Whys ##

Ask "Why" five times to understand the root of the problem.

Solve problem in stages. Incremental improvements.

But there is curse of the 5 blames.. Remember, it's not about blaming. It's about improving the system process.

Two simplified rules:

1. Be tolerant on the first mistake
2. Never allow the same mistake to be made twice



## Waste not ##

In our times of supreme technology advances, we should change our question.

"Can it be built?" >> "Should it be built"





## Other Thoughts ##

Optimization Vs Learning: Some of the features are merely optimization. It improves the product, but marginally. It is demoralizing when that happens.

In traditional management, when senior management don't see results, they assume the team did not work hard enough, or not good enough. This is when personnel changes and musical chair is being played.

Organisation has Muscle Memory. It is not easy to change the habits of a company. You are up against a system and individuals' changes.

Small, cross-functional team. 

Traditionally, definition of productivity is by functional excellence. Example, a programmer is expected to code all day.

That's why they hate meetings. But to achieve validated learning, an individual must cross-function.

Have I achieved product/market fit? If you are asking, you're not there yet.

As a rule, you should validate only when there is an Actionable result. That is at the Learn phase, you have possible actions. *Not everything* needs to be validated.



## What should you do? ##

After reading the book, I ask myself what should I do?

I suggest you validate the teachings of The Lean Startup.

Think about the minimum change you can introduced, change it, then measure and learn.
